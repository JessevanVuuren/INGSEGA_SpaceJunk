## General
  - Missiles don't inherit GERV's velocity at launch, so they trail the ship when it goes quickyl

## levl4:
  - change level requirement to protecting the mothership instead of gathering a set amount of debris.
    - modify scene manager's objective system to be able to handle this requirement
  - debris explode on collision with each other
  - debris who have been captured but not collected can't be pushed out by release mechanism
  - consider tweaking debris speed
  - nice to have: Fix HUD radar measuring distance from camera instead of distance from mohtersip
