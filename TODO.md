# bugs
## General
  - Missiles don't inherit GERV's velocity at launch, so they trail the ship when it goes quickyl
## Level2:
  - Debris who have been captured but not attracted can't be pushed out by release mechanism
## levl4:
  - debris explode on collision with each other
  - debris who have been captured but not attracted can't be pushed out by release mechanism
  - consider tweaking debris speed
  - nice to have: Fix HUD radar measuring distance from camera instead of distance from mohtersip
